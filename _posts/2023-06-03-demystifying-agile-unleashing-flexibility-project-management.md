In this section, we will compare the traditional Waterfall model with Agile methodology. The Waterfall model is a sequential and linear approach to project management, while Agile offers a more flexible and adaptive approach. 

The Waterfall model follows well-defined phases such as analysis, design, development, testing, and implementation, which are executed in a predetermined order. However, this approach comes with several challenges.

* **Rigid Planning**: The Waterfall model requires detailed planning at the beginning of the project, which can be problematic when requirements change or new information emerges during development.

* **Limited Adaptability**: Once a phase is completed, it is difficult to go back without revisiting the entire process, slowing down response to changes and innovation.

* **Lack of Customer Involvement**: Customer involvement mainly occurs at the end of the project when the results are already produced. This can lead to delayed feedback or misinterpretation of customer needs.

Agile methodology, on the other hand, offers a more flexible and adaptive approach to project management. It addresses the limitations of the Waterfall model by incorporating the following key elements:

* **Iterative and Incremental Development**: Agile breaks projects into short iterations allowing for regular feedback, continuous improvement, and the ability to adapt to changing requirements.

* **Collaboration and Customer Engagement**: Agile promotes frequent collaboration among team members and involves customers throughout the development process. This ensures that the product meets their needs and reduces the risk of misalignment.

* **Embracing Change**: Agile embraces the reality of changing requirements and priorities. It allows for flexibility, enabling teams to respond quickly to new information or customer feedback.

* **Continuous Delivery**: Agile focuses on delivering incremental value throughout the project, allowing for faster time-to-market and early feedback from stakeholders.

Overall, Agile methodology provides a more responsive and customer-centric approach, enabling teams to deliver high-quality products while adapting to evolving needs and market dynamics. It fosters collaboration, adaptability, and continuous improvement, leading to better project outcomes.

In February 2001, seventeen software practitioners gathered at a ski resort in Utah. Despite having different opinions on software development approaches, they agreed on one thing: **the status quo was not acceptable**. There was a need for a different approach to documentation-driven processes and heavy development methodologies.

The group formed what came to be known as the **Agile Alliance**. From their meeting emerged the **Agile Manifesto**, which consisted of four core values and twelve principles. These values and principles emphasized individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan.

The Agile Manifesto provided a new direction for software development, promoting agility, adaptability, and customer-centricity. It has since become a guiding framework for Agile methodologies such as Scrum, Kanban, DevOps, and Extreme Programming (XP), revolutionizing the way projects are managed and executed in the software industry.
