_Posted on **{{ page.date | date_to_string }}**_

## Introduction

![Developer vs Operation]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/developer-vs-operation.webp){:width="450" height="203" .responsive_img}

In the fast-paced world of software development, the need for efficient collaboration and seamless integration between development and operations teams has never been more critical. Traditionally, developers would spend months crafting code, only to hand it off to the quality assurance (QA) team for testing, before finally reaching the production environment, where an operations team would take over the management and support. Unfortunately, this siloed approach often led to limited collaboration, and issues encountered in production were resolved with difficulty, requiring modifications to the codebase.

The DevOps methodology was born to fill this gap. DevOps is an agile approach to organizational change that aims to bridge the traditional gaps between developer and IT operations roles. However, it is not simply a combination of developer, tester, and IT operation functions. DevOps represents a broader skill set and a fresh mindset that transcends the conventional silos of development, testing, and IT operations.

DevOps is one of the practices of Agile, operating at the practices level of the Agile Onion. It shares the Agile mindset, principles, and values with other Agile practices.

In the world of software development, the DevOps methodology brings forth a unique culture while aligning with the mindset, values, and principles of Agile. Building upon the insights shared in [this article]({{ site.baseurl }}/demystifying-agile-unleashing-flexibility-project-management/), DevOps introduces specific practices that address collaboration and integration challenges between development and operations teams.

**Automation** plays a pivotal role in DevOps, allowing organizations to streamline processes and eliminate manual bottlenecks. By automating tasks such as code testing, infrastructure provisioning, and deployment, DevOps fosters efficiency and reduces the risk of errors.

**Continuous integration** is a fundamental practice in DevOps, enabling development teams to regularly merge code changes into a shared repository. This approach promotes early identification of issues and facilitates collaboration among developers, ensuring a reliable and unified codebase.

DevOps also embraces **Continuous Deployment**, which automates the release of software changes directly into production environments. This practice empowers teams to rapidly respond to customer demands, validate new features, and swiftly incorporate feedback. By implementing a **"You Build it, You Run it"** principle, DevOps promotes shared responsibility, encouraging developers and operations teams to take ownership of the software throughout its lifecycle.

Through the adoption of these distinctive DevOps practices, complemented by the Agile mindset, values, and principles, organizations can achieve heightened efficiency, faster feedback loops, and improved collaboration across teams. Embracing automation, continuous integration, continuous deployment, and the sharing of responsibilities unlocks the full potential of DevOps and facilitates impactful software delivery.

## Streamlining Efficiency and Scaling with Automation in DevOps

Automation lies at the heart of DevOps and plays a pivotal role in enabling organizations to scale seamlessly on large infrastructures. For many years, the IT industry relied on manual modifications and maintenance across development, testing, and production systems, leading to various challenges. These challenges include:

* configuration drift;
* difficulty in scaling on extensive infrastructures;
* managing disaster recovery scenarios;
* an increased risk of errors.

The fundamental idea behind automation is to eliminate repetitive tasks through the use of code, such as scripts or programs. While the initial effort required to create these automations should be considered, the benefits are substantial, particularly when operations are repeated frequently. Automation not only saves time but also ensures consistency and accuracy in executing tasks.

Furthermore, automation empowers continuous monitoring of systems, enabling timely notifications in case of malfunctions or security compliance breaches. By automating routine activities, DevOps teams can free up valuable time and resources, allowing system engineers and other team members to focus on more critical tasks.

For instance, consider the scenario where a system engineer is tasked with performing a backup of a system twice a day. Automating this process would bring significant benefits, enabling the system engineer to allocate time towards more strategic activities.

In the realm of IT infrastructure management, several recurring activities form the backbone of operations, including infrastructure and software provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, incident management, change management, and more. Over time, these challenges have prompted the development of specialized tools to streamline and address these complexities. DevOps teams leverage a range of powerful tools such as Chef, Puppet, Ansible, Terraform, and others to tackle these infrastructure hurdles head-on.

## Streamlining Development and Ensuring Code Quality with Continuous Integration

Having worked as a software developer for over 30 years in large teams, I have experienced firsthand the challenges of maintaining a single repository as the single source of truth for code. Throughout the years, I have used various tools like CMVC, Rational Jazz, CVS, and eventually witnessed the rise of Git as the de facto standard for code management, with Linus Torvalds creating it specifically for managing the Linux codebase. 

Today, Git is often complemented by its sibling, GitHub, which provides additional useful tools such as Wiki, collaboration features, and pull requests.

However, one of the most significant challenges has always been merging changes from dozens of developers and ensuring a functional system. I still remember the lengthy merge sessions that could last for weeks to integrate changes made by each developer.

Over time, Continuous Integration (CI) practices have emerged to address these challenges. The CI approach dictates that each developer works on their feature branch in Git, making incremental changes and attempting to break down larger features into smaller, manageable pieces that can be developed within one or two days. These changes are then submitted to the maintainer via pull requests for code review. Once the code is approved, it is merged into a single commit. Following this process, an automated build and test system kicks off, where a suite of tests validates the integrity of the produced code. Developers not only maintain the application code but also the code related to building and testing.

It's important to note that this testing is primarily acceptance testing, which ensures that core functionalities continue to function correctly. It should not be confused with QA testing, which can also be automated and covers a broader range of scenarios.

In the realm of Continuous Integration, alongside Git and GitHub, several tools have emerged to automate the build and test processes. Popular tools like Jenkins, CircleCI, Travis, and many others have become essential components of the CI workflow, streamlining development, ensuring code quality, and enabling efficient collaboration among development teams.

## Streamlined Delivery and Rapid Feedback Loops with Continuous Deployment

Following the Continuous Integration phase, the software product becomes available to the QA team, which, in the world of DevOps, is typically the same team involved in development. The QA team is responsible for creating comprehensive test suites that cover a broader range of scenarios beyond the basic functionalities. From personal experience, achieving 100% test coverage with automated tests can be challenging, if not impossible, due to factors such as the difficulty of automation or time constraints. Consequently, it becomes necessary to have a subset of tests that are frequently executed under normal circumstances.

In the past, different phases of testing were commonly employed, including:

* functional tests;
* system tests (simulating real customer environments);
*  performance tests for critical features;
* scalability tests;
* global verification tests for multiple language support. 

Automation was often introduced to varying degrees within each testing phase, always considering the return on investment required to produce and maintain these test suites.

Moreover, with the advent of the Internet and the Cloud, the paradigm of product delivery to customers has shifted. Instead of selling products for customers to install in their own environments, companies now have the opportunity to offer products as Software as a Service (SaaS). As a result, the deployment process is managed directly by the product's manufacturing company, utilizing dedicated operations teams.

The concept behind continuous deployment is that with every successful change passing through the build, verification, QA testing, and other stages, it can be automatically deployed across different environments, following a pipeline that includes development, staging, and production environments.

By implementing continuous deployment, even small changes can be quickly identified and any potential issues can be addressed promptly. This approach fosters a rapid feedback loop, allowing developers and operations teams to work closely together, detect problems early on, and make necessary corrections swiftly.
