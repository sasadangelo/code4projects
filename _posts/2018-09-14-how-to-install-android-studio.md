# How to install Android Studio
_Posted on **{{ page.date | date_to_string }}**_

This is the second article of the [Android Game Programming]({{ site.baseurl }}/android-game-programming/) series. Here I would like to explain, step by step, how to install and configure Android Studio. It is the development environment that we will use to create our video game.

Android Studio is based on the IntelliJ platform and was developed by Google, it is the official software to develop applications for Android. The software is free and can be downloaded from this [website](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).

The procedure to install it is really simple because you need to launch the downloaded executable file and follow the proposed panels.

When the installation program starts, the **Welcome to Android Studio Setup** panel will appear, click on the **Next** button.

In the **Choose Components** panel, leave the default and click on the **Next** button.

Click on the **I Agree** button in the **License Agreement** panel.

Android Studio is installed and ready to run.

## How to configure Android Studio

After installing Android Studio you need to start the program and run a simple configuration wizard. In this procedure, it is sufficient to leave the default values and always press the **Next** button and, finally, the **Finish** button. This is the procedure in detail:

1. Start Android Studio.
2. Enter the **Welcome** panel and click the **Next** button.
3. In the **Install Type** panel, leave the default values and click the **Next** button.
4. Go to the **Verify Settings** panel and verify the inserted values and click on the **Finish** button and then on **Finish** button again.

The procedure described above is available in video format at the following [link](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html?pkg=studio).

## What’s next?

Now that you’ve learned how to install and configure your development environment, it's time to [create our first Android Hello World application]({{ site.baseurl }}/how-to-create-an-android-application/) that will be the starting point of our video game.
