  - feature-title: Android Game Programming
    feature-text: >
      This is the <b>Android Game Programming</b> article series. Here I will show you, step by step, how to write your first Android 
      game: Droids a Tetris clone. The series starts showing how to write your first Android application using Java and Android Studio. 
      Then I will explain the basic concepts of Game Programming. From this point forward, we will add to our application more features 
      like: file, resources, input, music, and graphics management. The result will be a Game Framework whose code you can reuse for 
      other games. Finally, we will use the Framework as base code to write Droids, a Tertris clone.
